				If it doesn't, then the defense gets the ball.<br>
				Once the offensive team gets the ball over the mid-court line, it can no longer have possession of the ball in the area behind the midcourt line.<br>
				If it does, the defense is awarded the ball.<br><br>The most recent international rules of basketball were approved February 2, 2014 by FIBA and became effective October 1 of that year.</p>
