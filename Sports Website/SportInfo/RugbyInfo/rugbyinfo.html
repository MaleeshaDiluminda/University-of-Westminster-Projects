			       <h2>RUGBY</h2>
			       <p>Rugby, football game played with an oval ball by two teams of 15 players (in rugby union play) or 13 players (in rugby league play). Both rugby union and rugby league have their origins in the style of football played at Rugby School in England. According to the sport’s lore, in 1823 William Webb Ellis, a pupil at Rugby School, defied the conventions of the day (that the ball may only be kicked forward) to pick up the ball and run with it in a game, thus creating the distinct handling game of rugby football. This “historical” basis of the game was well established by the early 1900s, about the same time that foundation myths were invented for baseball and Australian rules football. While it is known that Webb Ellis was a student at Rugby School at the time, there is no direct evidence of the actual event’s having taken place, though it was cited by the Old Rugbeian Society in an 1897 report on the origins of the game. Nevertheless, Rugby School, whose name has been given to the sport, was pivotal in the development of rugby football, and the first rules of the game that became rugby union football were established there in 1845.</p>

			       <h2>FACTS!</h2>
			       <p>Rugby - A match is split into two 40-minute halves, played on a rectangular field, with a referee and two touch judges or assistant referees. Half-time is a mandatory rest period for players and this is limited to a maximum of 10 minutes after which both teams change ends.<br><br>
				     Unlike most other ball sports, a rugby ball is oval in shape and traditionally made from hand-stitched leather. However, this meant that during rainy and muddy conditions, the ball was more difficult to handle, as it would get heavier and become more slippery. Modern technology has seen vast improvements towards high tech synthetic waterproof all-weather rugby balls that make handling easier even in adverse conditions. Jerseys, socks, shorts and boots make up a player’s kit and for safety reasons, a mouth guard is essential along with headgear if required by a player.</p>
