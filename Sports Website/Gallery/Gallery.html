					<b>On this day in 2006, Sri Lankan batting pair of Mahela Jayawardene set the World record partnership in Test cricket, as their partnership finished on 624 runs.</b><br>

					Sri Lanka faced two early blows in the form of Sanath Jayasuriya and Upul Tharanga and were reduced to 14/2.But the introduction of Sangakkara and Jayawardene at the crease totally changed the complexion of the game.<br>
					Wicket-keeper batsman Sangakkara went on to score 287 runs while skipper Mahela smashed 374 during the course.

					With 54 home runs in 1920 and 59 more in 1921, Ruth captured the attention of a nation.<br>
					But Ruth’s legend was more than just numbers. He became an oversized symbol of America’s power, a brilliant man with human flaws that made him seem more real than mythic.<br>
					The new exhibit will feature artifacts that tell both sides of this story, such as a trophy presented to Ruth by his “Baltimore admirers” on May 20, 1922.<br>
					<b>The garment was snapped up for $5.64m (£4.4m) at auction in New York on June 13, 2019

					The shirt dates from the 1928-1930 period of Ruth's long career, in which he became an early sporting superstar.
